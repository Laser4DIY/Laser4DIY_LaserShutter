This is the repository is part of the [Laser4DIY project](http://www.laser4diy.org/).

## Specs 

The laser shutter was designed for CO2 glass tube laser sources typically used in laser cutters, with a power of no more than 50W. The shutter itself is made of copper which has a high reflectivity at the wave length of ~10µm. For other wave lengths this is design cannot be used.
For a laser shutter to be effective, it has to be integrated into the machine safety concept. The electronics circuit that is included in this documentation can only serve as an example and has to be adapted to your needs.
